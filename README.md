# tic-tac-toe
Browser-based tic-tac-toe game. Play a game of Tic Tac Toe against the computer.

# demo
Demo app here: [http://ortonomy.github.io/tic-tac-toe](http://ortonomy.github.io/tic-tac-toe) 

# technology
Built using HTML, SCSS, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and the Materialize libary.

# features
Current functionalities include:

- An unbeatable AI implemented using the Minimax algorithm.
- A sassy AI 'avatar' who makes comments before and after every move. 
- Choose to play as X or O.
- Start a new game after the current game is finished.

# future improvements
Ideas include:

- Include sound-effects on hover, make a move, win or draw states. Will use WebAudio API
- Running stats of CPU wins, draws, and human wins (as if that's possible!)
- Swap the tokens of the players so whoever goes first is X.
